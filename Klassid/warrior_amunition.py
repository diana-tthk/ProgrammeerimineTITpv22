# we have warrior (can use the one from warrior.py as a
# basis). Also we have several weapons: sword, frist
# Sword makes 10-20 of damage. Frist makes 0-15
# Warrior can have sword (if no weapon, then 
# warrior uses only frists). At the begginig of game
# warriors roll the dice. If ones score is 3 or more,
# one gets a sword. Extend the game writen previously 
# according to this scenario
